Code Simplicity: You can call the function without specifying values for all of its parameters, reducing the amount of code you need to write and making it easier to read.
Improved Function Reusability: You can reuse the function with different sets of parameters, making it more versatile and flexible.
Increased Function Overloading: You can have multiple versions of the same function with different default argument values, reducing the need for separate functions with similar functionality.
Improved Readability: Default arguments can make it easier to understand what a function does and how it should be used.
Backwards Compatibility: You can add default arguments to existing functions without breaking existing code that calls the function, preserving backwards compatibility.
