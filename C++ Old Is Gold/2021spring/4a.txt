Inheritance in Object Oriented Programming (OOP) supports usability in a number of ways:
Code Reusability: Inheritance allows for the reuse of existing code from a base class in a derived class, reducing the amount of code that needs to be written and maintained. This makes the development process more efficient and less error-prone.
Abstraction: Inheritance allows for the creation of a hierarchy of classes, where a base class defines the common attributes and behaviors that are shared by all derived classes. This abstraction makes it easier for developers to understand the relationships between classes and to use the classes in a consistent and predictable way.
Polymorphism: Inheritance supports polymorphism, which allows objects of different derived classes to be treated as objects of the base class. This makes it easier to write generic code that can work with objects of different derived classes, increasing the flexibility and maintainability of the code.
Extensibility: Inheritance makes it possible to extend the functionality of a base class by adding new attributes and behaviors in a derived class. This allows for a natural way to evolve the code over time, without having to rewrite existing code or breaking existing functionality.
Overall, inheritance supports usability in OOP by promoting code reuse, abstraction, polymorphism, and extensibility, making the development process more efficient and effective.
